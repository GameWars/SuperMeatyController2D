SuperMeatyController2D
======================
A unity controller project inspired off of Super Meat Boy style platformer controlls. Rather than focusing on creative and
odd ways of implementing platformer controlls, this unity project focuses on how the controlls feel.

To Use
======================
Clone the project in your desktop. Launch Unity and select open new project. Browse to where you store your cloned projects
and open that folder, then launch the project.

How to use
======================
Code may be a little bit messy, feel free to fix it up. All character controllers are in CharacterController2D.cs. Open the demo
scene and try it for yourself.

Plans for the future
====================
-possible add wall jumping...possibly
-smoother "sudden stops" after letting go of key
-make the key release, hold, and down detection more flexible
-add sprinting

Feel free to add anything you want
